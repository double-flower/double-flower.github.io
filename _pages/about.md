This is Jianhua Gao's personal homepage.

A short introduction
======
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Artificial Intelligence at Beijing Normal University and collaborate with Professor [HuangHua](https://vmcl.bnu.edu.cn/group/teacher/dcdaea79b5e54b75b532795109a85a34.htm) and [Weixing Ji](https://jiweixing.github.io/). I received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Beijing Institute of Technology in June 2023, and my advisor is Professor [Weixing Ji](https://jiweixing.github.io/).

Research interest 
======
Parallel and high performance computing
* Optimization on sparse matrix computation, especially sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) and general sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM)
* Performance optimization on GPU
