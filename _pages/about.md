This is Jianhua Gao's personal homepage.

A short introduction
======
I am currently working toward PhD with the School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology. I am expected to recieve Phd in July 2023. I received the BS degree from the College of Mathematics, Taiyuan University of Technology, China, in 2017.

Research interest 
======
Parallel and high performance computing
* Optimization on sparse matrix computation, especially sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) and general sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM)
* Performance optimization on GPU
